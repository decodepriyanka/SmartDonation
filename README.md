# SmartDonation System 
Introduction :
The definition of this app "Spread A Smile".The basic concept, which is emerged out from this project is to provide necessary items to the one in need.
This is an Android application that provides a platform for donation of useful items (food, clothes, etc.) to the nearest NGO. Many people,
institutes wish to donate things to needy organizations. 
The main problem faced by donors in offline donation systems is the lack of convenience. Offline donation systems require donors to physically visit
a location or send a cheque through the mail, which can be inconvenient and time-consuming. This can discourage potential donors from contributing, 
as they may prefer a more convenient and accessible way to make a donation. This project aims to solve this problem by turning to online donation systems,
which can provide a more convenient and secure way for donors to contribute, while also allowing for easier tracking and reporting of donations.

CONCLUSION : 

In comparison, when we compare ourself with other donation softwares such as A and B, we have a configurable donation items section but they have a limited charity option. That's why we have a wide range of items that can be donated when compared with other donation softwares who are mostly focused on the donation based on money or foods. 
Drawback of our software is that we have not yet configured a donation system for blood and cash, which we have planned to add in our software in future. We will
We will also be adding campaigns for green environments and awareness about other environmental issues.
